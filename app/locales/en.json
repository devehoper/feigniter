It includes features like routing, caching, translation, and error handling. By default Feigniter uses Jquery, Jquery UI, bootstrap 5.3, fontawesome, DataTables 2.2.2, i18next. All the above libs are stored local, and will keep strict to its versions.",

            "body": "Imagine you want to build a super cool treehouse. Feigniter is like a giant box of special LEGOs just for building websites! Instead of starting from scratch with wood and nails, you get lots of ready-made pieces that fit together perfectly. This makes building your website faster and way more fun."

            "title": "üó∫Ô∏è How does the website know where to go? (Routing)",
            "body": "Routing is like a map for your website. When you type a URL with a # symbol, Feigniter looks at the map to see which page to show you."

            "title": "üß† What's a Controller?",
            "body": "A Controller is the \"brain\" for each page. If your webpage were a robot, the Controller would be the computer inside that tells its arms and legs what to do. It handles all the logic, like what happens when you click a button."

            "title": "üé® What's a View?",
            "body": "A View is the \"face\" of the page. It's the HTML code that decides what the page looks like‚Äîwhere the pictures go, what the text says, and what color the buttons are. The Controller (the brain) loads the View (the face) to show it to the user."

You should **never change this file!**\n                        <br><br>\n                        Instead, you make your changes in <strong>`userConfig.js`</strong>. Think of `userConfig.js` as your own special settings file that tells the game, \"Hey, I want to play on hard mode!\" or \"I want my character to wear a blue hat!\". Your settings in `userConfig.js` will always win."

Before you save any information (like a username or email), you give it to the Model with a list of rules. The Model checks if the data follows all the rules.
